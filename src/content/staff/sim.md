Heyy! I'm Simuon but most call me Sim! I graduated from LubaMera Institute of Aesthetics & Cosmetology in 2016. I've always been fascinated with beauty and knew that I've always wanted a career in that industry. I have been an experienced Nail Technician for 6+ years now. My new chapter with The Blonding Room is very exciting because I'll be joining a great team of driven ladies who are passionate about what they do! When I'm not in the salon I enjoy going to the gym, adventuring outdoors and mostly hanging with my family. I'm so thankful and grateful for my clients that I've built relationships with throughout the years and just as excited to be welcoming new clients at The Blonding Room.
