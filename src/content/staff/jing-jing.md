Hi! My name is Jing-Jing, Jing or JJ for short! As a child I knew hairstyling would be my career of choice. I love creating dimensional blondes and brunettes for that perfect “lived in hair”. A fun fact about me is I've had my hair every colour except blue! When I'm not working behind the chair you can typically find me lounging around the house with my husband and two pups or spending quality time with my family. I am so grateful for the relationships I've built over the years whether it be with clients, coworkers, or other talented stylist; this job is truly a dream and so rewarding. I look forward to every new year and to the clients I have yet to meet!
