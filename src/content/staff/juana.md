Hello everyone, my name is Juana (pronounced Ju-Anna). I'm excited to start this new journey by joining The Blonding Room. I also find myself very fortunate, as I get to be surrounded by many other talented women and new opportunities. I was born in London, ON but grew up in Brantford, ON. I've always felt like London was my home and where I belong. With having 2 older sisters, we always did each other's nails, hair, make-up, etc. So for me, wanting a career in the beauty industry was always on my mind. When I'm not in the salon I enjoy spending time with my family, hiking, baking and doing puzzles. I'm looking forward to the future here with my new work family and getting to meet new clients but appreciating those who have supported me during this time as a I navigate towards the next chapter in my life.
